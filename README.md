<h2>Guess My Number Game</h2>

- A simple JavaScript game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 20. The user will keep getting feedback about the number he has put in, 
 if the guessed number is higher or lower than the one he should be guessing. 
 -The user will start off with a score of 20, and if the score strikes 0 the user will lose the game.
 - If the user finds the correct number, the screen will go green and the user wins the game. The user can restart the game by pressing AGAIN! in the left-hand top corner!
